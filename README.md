# R_Project2

The aim of this excercise is to make some simple calculations on a dataframe that consists a large portfolio of securities.

In the first part of the excercise I create a new dataframe containing the maximum daily return for each month, for each stock.
Each row in the data represents the maximum daily return in a given month, for a given stock

In the second part of the excercise I perform an independent decile group analysis on a specific month within the data set. 
Then I identify a stock in a certain decile based one some criteria.
